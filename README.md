# Run-Length-Encoding
This repository contains a simple file compression program implemented in assembly language. The program uses the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm to compress consecutive repeated characters in a text file. It serves as a learning example for low-level programming and file manipulation in assembly.
